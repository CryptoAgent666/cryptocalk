## [2026-03-18] (update 20) — Custom FAQ for top 10 EN calculators

### Changed
- **profit-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 generic FAQ Q&A pairs with search-targeted questions: "How much profit will I make if Bitcoin goes up 10%?", "How do I calculate my crypto profit and loss?", "What is a good ROI on crypto?", "Should I calculate profit before or after taxes?", "How do exchange fees affect my crypto profit?", "Can I calculate profit on short positions?". Updated both visible `<details>` FAQ and JSON-LD `FAQPage` schema.
- **mining-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with 2026-relevant questions: "Is Bitcoin mining still profitable in 2026?", "How much does it cost to mine 1 Bitcoin?", "What is the best ASIC miner to buy right now?", "How much electricity does a Bitcoin miner use per month?", "How long does it take to break even on a mining rig?", "What happens to mining profitability after the next halving?".
- **dca-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with DCA-specific questions: "What if I had invested $100 per month in Bitcoin for the last 5 years?", "Is DCA better than buying crypto all at once?", "How much should I invest in crypto per month?", "Should I DCA daily, weekly, or monthly?", "When should I stop dollar-cost averaging?", "Does DCA work for Ethereum and altcoins too?".
- **tax-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with tax-focused queries: "How much tax do I pay on crypto profits in the US?", "Do I have to pay taxes if I convert Bitcoin to Ethereum?", "Which countries have zero crypto tax?", "Can I deduct crypto losses from my taxes?", "Are staking rewards and airdrops taxable?", "What is the difference between FIFO and LIFO for crypto taxes?".
- **staking-calculator.astro**: Added `faq` prop with 6 custom Q&A pairs (previously used generic template FAQ): "How much can I earn staking crypto per year?", "Is crypto staking worth it in 2026?", "What is the difference between APY and APR in staking?", "Are staking rewards taxable income?", "What is validator commission and how does it affect my rewards?", "Can I lose money staking crypto?".

- **converter.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with conversion queries: "How much is 1 Bitcoin worth in US dollars right now?", "How do I convert Bitcoin to my local currency?", "Why is the crypto price different on this converter vs my exchange?", "How many satoshis are in 1 Bitcoin?", "Can I use this to convert Ethereum to USD?", "Does this converter account for exchange fees when buying crypto?".
- **gas-fee-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with gas fee queries: "How much does it cost to send Ethereum right now?", "Why is swapping tokens so much more expensive than a simple transfer?", "Which blockchain has the cheapest gas fees?", "What is the best time to make Ethereum transactions?", "What is Gwei and how does it relate to ETH?", "How do I save money on Ethereum gas fees?".
- **break-even-calculator.astro**: Replaced 6 FAQ pairs with break-even queries: "How much do I need to gain to recover from a 50% crypto loss?", "What is my break-even price if I bought Bitcoin at different prices?", "How much do trading fees add to my break-even price?", "Should I buy more crypto to lower my average price?", "Why is my portfolio down 80% but the coin only needs to 5x to recover?", "How do I calculate break-even after accounting for taxes?".

Total: 60 new FAQ Q&A pairs across 10 calculators (6 per page), all targeting real search queries with specific numbers and examples. Both visible HTML `<details>` sections and JSON-LD `FAQPage` structured data updated in sync. Build verified: 754 pages, no errors.

## [2026-03-18] (update 19) — Fix stale data references in calculator-seo-ext.ts

### Fixed
- **Bitcoin hashrate references**: Updated all 7 occurrences of "≈600 EH/s" to "≈800 EH/s" across EN + 5 localized sections (es, pt, tr, hi, ru) in hashrate-converter benchmarks. Also updated inline network share math example (600M TH/s -> 800M TH/s, solo mining estimate 28 -> 38 years).
- **ETH current-price references**: Replaced "$3,000/ETH" with "$2,300/ETH" in 6 EN sections (converter validation, gas-fee validation, unit-converter interpret/scenarios, gas benchmarks, node-calculator scenario) plus all localized equivalents. Recalculated dependent math: gas cost benchmarks (e.g., ETH transfer $1.26 -> $0.97), validator staking economics ($96K -> $73.6K for 32 ETH), unit-converter DeFi cost example ($4.50 -> $3.45/call).
- **BTC current-price reference**: Updated ASIC mining benchmark from "$60,000 BTC" to "$73,000 BTC" with adjusted profitability range ($8-15/day -> $10-18/day).
- **Stale year labels**: Changed "Typical lending parameters (2024)" to "(2026)" and "Reference hashrate units by coin/algorithm (2024)" to "(2026)" in EN section.
- **MEV benchmarks**: Added 2024-2025 context note ("with 2024-2025 estimates surpassing $900 million annually") to the 2023 MEV extraction benchmark in the MEV calculator section.

### Not changed (correctly historical)
- Halving calculator "$60,000/BTC" references (describe pre-2024 halving conditions)
- Pip-value "$60,000" (illustrative historical comparison)
- Tax calculator "$3,000" (taxable gain math, not ETH price)
- Hardware cost "$3,000 ASIC" and "$500-$3,000" ranges
- Exchange-fees "$3,000" trade size examples

## [2026-03-18] (update 18) — Localized FAQ for 11 risk/analytics calculators (ES/PT/TR/HI/RU)

### Added
- **src/i18n/calculator-faq.ts**: New file containing custom localized FAQ for 11 risk/analytics calculators (sharpe, sortino, calmar, treynor, information-ratio, kelly, var, drawdown, risk-of-ruin, slippage, trade-expectancy) across 5 non-EN languages (ES, PT, TR, HI, RU). Each calculator has 6 Q&A pairs per language targeting real search queries. Total: 330 localized Q&A pairs.
- **LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro**: Updated FAQ resolution logic to check `CALCULATOR_FAQ[slug][lang]` before falling back to generic template FAQ from `faq-dictionary.ts`. EN pages are unaffected (they pass FAQ inline via props). Localized pages (55 total: 11 calcs x 5 langs) now display calculator-specific FAQ instead of generic boilerplate.

## [2026-03-18] (update 17) — Brand titles and unique meta descriptions for all 51 calculators x 6 languages

### Changed
- **EN title branding (calculator-meta.ts)**: Appended " | CryptoCalk" to all 51 EN calculator titles. All titles verified under 60-character limit. Longest: "Compound Interest Calculator (Crypto) | CryptoCalk" (51 chars).
- **EN meta descriptions**: Already unique and specific — no changes needed.
- **ES meta descriptions**: Replaced 51 boilerplate "Herramienta gratuita: [Tool]. Calcula resultados al instante con supuestos transparentes..." descriptions with unique, calculator-specific descriptions in Spanish.
- **PT meta descriptions**: Replaced 51 boilerplate "Ferramenta gratuita: [Tool]. Calcule resultados em segundos com premissas claras..." descriptions with unique, calculator-specific descriptions in Portuguese.
- **TR meta descriptions**: Replaced 51 boilerplate "Ücretsiz araç: [Tool]. Şeffaf varsayımlar ve güncel piyasa verileriyle..." descriptions with unique, calculator-specific descriptions in Turkish.
- **HI meta descriptions**: Replaced 51 boilerplate "मुफ्त टूल: [Tool]। पारदर्शी मान्यताओं और अपडेटेड मार्केट डेटा..." descriptions with unique, calculator-specific descriptions in Hindi.
- **RU meta descriptions**: Replaced 51 boilerplate "Бесплатный инструмент: [Tool]. Считайте результаты мгновенно с прозрачными допущениями..." descriptions with unique, calculator-specific descriptions in Russian.

Total: 51 titles branded + 255 boilerplate descriptions replaced (51 x 5 languages) with unique, SEO-optimized descriptions specific to each calculator's function.

## [2026-03-18] (update 16) — Add htmlFor accessibility attributes to 10 calculator components

### Fixed
- **Form label accessibility across 10 calculators**: Added `htmlFor` attributes to 55 `<label>` elements, properly associating each label with its corresponding `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` element via matching `id`. This enables screen readers to announce the correct label when an input receives focus and allows users to click the label text to focus the input. Calculators updated: ProfitCalculator (6 labels), DCACalculator (3), MiningCalculator (6), TaxCalculator (5), StakingRewardsCalculator (6), RoiCalculator (4), BreakEvenCalculator (7), LiquidationCalculator (5), PositionSizeCalculator (8), GasFeeCalculator (5). Labels for toggle-button groups (Position Type, Margin Type, etc.) were intentionally skipped since they control button groups rather than focusable inputs.

## [2026-03-18] (update 15) — Update year references in localized seo-ext sections

### Changed
- **calculator-seo-ext.ts**: Updated 27 benchmark year references from "(2024)" to "(2026)" across all 5 localized language sections (es, pt, tr, hi, ru). Categories updated: bridge cost benchmarks (ES, RU), lending parameters (all 5 langs), GPU mining benchmarks (all 5), ASIC mining benchmarks (all 5), electricity cost benchmarks (all 5), hashrate reference units (all 5), crypto salary adoption (all 5). Historical references (e.g. "2024 halving", timestamp examples) preserved unchanged.

## [2026-03-18] (update 14) — Comprehensive quality audit implementation

### Added
- **Skip-to-content accessibility link**: Added `<a href="#main-content" class="skip-to-content">` as first element in `<body>` (Layout.astro). Visually hidden, appears on focus for keyboard navigation. Added `id="main-content"` to all 44 `<main>` elements across all page templates.
- **Vitest testing infrastructure**: Added vitest 4.1 + @testing-library/react + jsdom. Created 32 tests covering ErrorBoundary component (6 tests) and core calculator math formulas (26 tests: ROI, break-even, DCA, compound interest, liquidation price, impermanent loss). Added `npm run test` and `npm run test:watch` scripts.
- **Environment variable support for API keys**: Created `.env` and `.env.example` with `PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY` and `PUBLIC_CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY`. Updated `cryptoPriceService.ts` to use `import.meta.env` with hardcoded fallbacks for zero-downtime migration.

### Changed
- **Sitemap lastmod removed**: Removed `serialize` function from astro.config.mjs that was setting identical `lastmod` dates on all 1,147 URLs (actively harmful for SEO). Astro now generates sitemap without misleading lastmod, which is better per Google's crawl efficiency guidelines.

## [2026-03-18] (update 11) — Fix TypeScript `any` types across 20 files

### Fixed
- **TypeScript strict typing in cryptoPriceService.ts**: Replaced 3 `any` annotations with proper inline types for CryptoCompare (`{ close: number; time: number }`) and CoinCap (`{ time: number; priceUsd: string }`) API response entries.
- **TypeScript strict typing in 16 calculator components**: Replaced `(c: any)` with `(c: { id: string; name: string; symbol: string; thumb: string })` in CoinGecko search response mapping across DCACalculator, CryptoConverter, FundingRateCalculator, LeverageCalculator, LiquidationCalculator, MarginCalculator, MarketCapCalculator, MarketCapComparator, PipCalculator, PositionSizeCalculator, ProfitCalculator, ReverseRoiCalculator, StakingRewardsCalculator, TpSlCalculator, ImpermanentLossCalculator, AirdropCalculator.
- **DCACalculator.tsx**: Changed event handler `(e: any)` to `(e: React.MouseEvent)`.
- **WhatIfCalculator.tsx**: Changed `(_: any, i: number)` to `(_: [number, number], i: number)` in chart price filter.
- **AsicMiningCalculator.tsx**: Replaced `as any` with typed inline interface `{ difficulty24?: number; difficulty?: number; block_reward24?: number; block_reward?: number; exchange_rate: number }`.
- **GpuMiningCalculator.tsx**: Replaced `as any` with typed inline interface `{ nethash?: number; block_reward24?: number; block_reward?: number; exchange_rate: number }`.

## [2026-03-18] (update 10) — Update stale year references in SEO content

### Changed
- **calculator-seo-ext.ts**: Updated 7 year references: Tax Calculator "2024" → "2025" (current tax year), Bridge Cost "2024" → "2026", GPU Mining "2024" → "2026" (2 instances), ASIC Mining "2024" → "2026", Mining Electricity "2024" → "2026", Crypto Salary "2024" → "2026".
- **ui-strings.ts**: Updated UK CGT exemption year from "(2024/25)" to "(2025/26)" across all 5 localized language sections (es, pt, tr, hi, ru) — 10 string occurrences total (key + value per language).

## [2026-03-18] (update 9) — Descriptive alt text on coin thumbnail images

### Fixed
- **Accessibility: coin thumbnail alt attributes across 17 calculator components (20 instances)**: Replaced empty `alt=""` with descriptive `alt={coin.name}` (or equivalent variable) on all coin thumbnail `<img>` elements in dropdown suggestion lists. Affected files: PipCalculator, DCACalculator, LeverageCalculator, CryptoConverter (2), PositionSizeCalculator, TpSlCalculator, MarginCalculator, ProfitCalculator, StakingRewardsCalculator, WhatIfCalculator, MarketCapComparator (2), ReverseRoiCalculator, ImpermanentLossCalculator (2), FundingRateCalculator, LiquidationCalculator, MarketCapCalculator, AirdropCalculator. Improves screen reader support and image SEO.

## [2026-03-18] (update 8) — ErrorBoundary wrapping for all calculators

### Added
- **ErrorBoundary HOC wrapping on all 64 calculator components**: Each calculator is now wrapped with `withErrorBoundary()` HOC from `ErrorBoundary.tsx`. If a calculator throws a runtime error during rendering, users see a friendly "Something went wrong" message with a Reload button instead of a white screen. Affected: all Calculator, Comparator, and Converter `.tsx` components. Non-calculator components (ThemeToggle, LanguageSwitcher) are excluded. Build verified: 754 pages, no errors.

## [2026-03-18] (update 7) — Calculator defaults refresh to March 2026

- **Staking**: ATOM APY 18%→13%, ETH APY 3.5%→3.2%, SOL scenario $150→$95
- **Halving**: priceAfter18m filled ($126K Oct 2025 ATH), hashrate 700→800 EH/s
- **Profit**: BTC scenario $50K→$65K, ETH $3,500→$2,300
- **Leverage**: entry price $65K→$73K
- **Bridge**: ETH gas $4.50→$0.50, added Solana chain

## [2026-03-18] (update 6) — Localized category hub body copy

### Added
- **Localized bodyCopy for 40 category hub pages**: 8 categories × 5 languages (es, pt, tr, hi, ru), 3 paragraphs each. Previously these pages had no body prose, making them thinner than EN versions.

## [2026-03-18] (update 5) — FAQ, internal links, OG images

### Added
- **Custom FAQ for 11 risk calculators**: 6 keyword-rich Q&A per page replacing generic template FAQ
- **20 contextual internal links in seo-body-text.ts**: 2 per section across 10 EN generic sections
- **7 internal links in About page**: staking, tax, DCA, liquidation, mining, profit, converter

## [2026-03-18] (update 4) — Risk calculator unique content

### Added
- **Unique SEO content for 11 risk calculators**: calculator-seo-content.ts entries for Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Treynor, Information Ratio, Kelly, VaR, Drawdown, Risk of Ruin, Slippage, Trade Expectancy. All 6 languages, specific formulas and thresholds.

## [2026-03-18] (update 3) — Title + meta description SEO fixes

### Fixed
- **27 EN title tags shortened to < 60 chars**: Dropped secondary descriptors, standardized ` | CryptoCalk` separator. Longest: 48 chars. Previously 27 titles exceeded 60 chars (worst: 77).
- **51 boilerplate meta descriptions replaced**: All generic "Calculate crypto outcomes instantly with transparent assumptions..." patterns in `calculator-meta.ts` replaced with unique, keyword-rich descriptions per calculator. Each starts with "Free", includes the tool name, and describes specific functionality.

## [2026-03-18] (update 2) — SEO audit Phase 1+2 technical fixes

### Fixed
- **BreadcrumbList 2→3 levels on ~35 EN pages**: Home → Category → Calculator. Uses calculator-category-map lookup.
- **Sitemap `<lastmod>`**: All 1154 URLs now include modification date via serialize callback.
- **`twitter:site` / `twitter:creator`**: Added @yakovlevka3 on all pages.
- **Homepage H1**: "The Smartest Crypto Calculator Hub" → "50+ Free Crypto Calculators".
- **Category hub H1**: Now appends "Calculators" in all languages (e.g., "Investment Calculators").
- **About page BreadcrumbList**: Added Home → About schema. Updated dateModified.

## [2026-03-18] — Content quality audit fixes

### Fixed
- **About page rewrite**: Removed "Vibecoder" title — replaced with "Founder & Lead Developer". Expanded from ~300 words to ~1000 words with four new sections: Mission (3 paragraphs), Meet the Creator (verifiable credentials, since-2017 crypto experience, zanimaem.kz/calk.kz track record), How We Build Our Calculators (formula verification, real-time data, edge case testing, regular audits), and Why Trust CryptoCalk (open formulas, client-side execution, no ads, no signups, 6 languages, regular updates). Strengthens E-E-A-T for YMYL compliance.
- **Localized About pages (5 languages)**: Replaced all vibecoder/vibecoding/вайбкодинг/वाइबकोडिंग references with professional developer terminology across ES, PT, TR, HI, RU. Updated role titles, bios, and highlight descriptions.
- **calculator-seo-ext.ts phantom keys**: Fixed 20 slug keys that did not match actual calculator-meta slugs (e.g., `'market-cap'` → `'market-cap-calculator'`, `'ico-roi'` → `'ico-roi-calculator'`). These entries were effectively dead code — the content existed but was never loaded. All 51 calculators now have unique overrides for 8 sections (interpret, scenarios, checklist, mistakes, benchmarks, execution, hygiene, validation) in all 6 languages.
- **Content parity**: Previously 20 of 51 calculators fell back to generic template text for 8 out of 10 SEO sections. Now all 51 × 6 = 306 localized calculator pages receive unique content.

### Changed
- `src/pages/about.astro` — full rewrite with methodology and trust sections
- `src/pages/[lang]/about.astro` — updated all 5 language content blocks
- `src/i18n/calculator-seo-ext.ts` — fixed 20 phantom keys, added missing calculator entries

## [2026-03-09] (update 10) — React hydration fix + dark mode FOUC

### Fixed
- **React Error #418 (hydration mismatch)**: Корневая причина — `ThemeToggle.tsx` вызывал `getInitialTheme()` прямо в `useState(getInitialTheme)`, что читало `localStorage` при инициализации. SSR рендерил `'light'` (нет `window`), а клиент при гидрации получал `'dark'` — несовпадение. **Фикс**: убрана функция `getInitialTheme`, начальное состояние всегда `'light'`, реальное значение считывается в `useEffect`. Ошибка устранена на всех 754 страницах.
- **Dark mode FOUC (Flash Of Unstyled Content)**: Скрипт инициализации темы был расположен в конце `<head>` после шрифтов, фавиконов и GA-скриптов. Браузер успевал отрисовать страницу в светлой теме до применения `data-theme`. **Фикс**: скрипт перенесён на самый верх `<head>` (сразу после `<meta viewport>`), обёрнут в try/catch. Тема применяется до парсинга CSS.

## [2026-03-09] (update 9) — AdSense readiness fixes

### Changed
- **A1 — Privacy Policy: Google Ads/AdSense раздел**: Расширен раздел 4 "Cookies and Tracking" — добавлено подробное описание Google Analytics, Google AdSense, DoubleClick cookies и ссылки на opt-out. Старый раздел с CoinGecko перемещён в новый раздел 4.
- **A2 — Privacy Policy: email контакт**: В разделе "Contact" теперь явно указан адрес `support@cryptocalk.com` и ссылка на форму.
- **A1/A2 — Privacy Policy: дополнительные разделы**: Добавлены разделы "Children's Privacy", "Your Rights", "Changes to This Policy". Дата last updated обновлена до 09/03/2026.
- **A3 — 404: SiteFooter**: Добавлены импорт и рендер `<SiteFooter lang="en" />` на странице 404 для консистентной навигации.
- **A4 — Footer: Methodology ссылка**: В колонку "Trust & Legal" добавлена ссылка на `/methodology/` (`t.methodologyPolicy`).
- **A5 — Organization Schema: email**: В `organizationSchema` на `index.astro` добавлены поля `email` и `logo`. В `contactPoint` добавлен `email`.
- **A7 — Cookie Consent Banner (CMP)**: Полностью переписан `src/components/CookieBanner.astro` с поддержкой 6 языков, accept/decline кнопок, анимации slide-in/out. В `Layout.astro` добавлены consent defaults (`ad_storage: denied`) перед загрузкой GA — AdSense CMP compliance. Согласие сохраняется в `localStorage` и восстанавливается мгновенно при следующей загрузке страницы.

### Added
- Consent mode v2 defaults в `Layout.astro` (блокирует рекламные cookies до согласия пользователя).

## [2026-03-09] (update 8)

### Changed
- **N1 — Related заголовок обёрнут условием**: `<h2>Related</h2>` теперь не рендерится если нет ни related-ссылок, ни хаба категории.
- **N2 — FAQ/Related в систему has()**: Секции FAQ и Related теперь контролируются через `calculator-sections.ts` наравне со всеми остальными 10 SEO-секциями. По умолчанию — включены.
- **N3 — ShareCalculator + mobile CSS в 35 custom EN страницах**: Добавлен импорт `ShareCalculator` + обёртка `.calc-scope`, добавлены mobile media queries, исправлен `<SiteFooter lang="en" />` с пропом `lang`.
- **N4 — Убран мёртвый код `typeof lang`**: Во всех 137 файлах заменён `typeof lang !== 'undefined' ? lang : 'en'` на `'en'` (для root-страниц) или `lang` (для `[lang]`-страниц).
- **N5 — Hub backlink текст в translations.ts**: Добавлен ключ `allCategoryCalculators` для всех 6 языков. Тернарный каскад в шаблоне заменён на `t.allCategoryCalculators.replace('{category}', categoryName)`.
- **N7 — CSS дедупликация**: Создан `src/styles/calculator-page.css` с ~200 строками общих стилей (header, breadcrumb, calculator-section, seo-content, mobile breakpoints). Импортируется из шаблона + 35 custom EN страниц. Удалено ~500 строк дублированного CSS из `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` и ~180 строк из каждой custom EN страницы.

### Added
- `src/styles/calculator-page.css` — единый файл общих стилей для всех калькуляторных страниц.
- `allCategoryCalculators` ключ в `src/i18n/translations.ts` для 6 языков.
- `faq` и `related` как управляемые секции в `src/data/calculator-sections.ts`.

## [2026-03-09] (update 7)

### Changed
- **D1 — Убран дублирующий Related блок**: Удалён inline "See also" callout из `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` и из 10 custom EN страниц. Related calculators теперь отображается единожды — в конце страницы в полном виде.
- **D2 — ShareCalculator перенесён после калькулятора**: В `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` `<ShareCalculator>` теперь рендерится после `<slot name="calculator">`, а не до. Пользователь сначала пользуется инструментом, потом делится результатом.
- **D3 — Мобильный UX: уменьшен padding**: `calculator-section` padding снижен с 40px до 28px (десктоп) и 16px (мобиль). `calc-header` на мобиле выровнен по левому краю. Калькулятор теперь виден выше на смартфонах без скролла.
- **D4 — CategoryHubPage: карточки на мобиле, таблица на десктопе**: Убрано дублирование списка инструментов. `tools-mobile` (grid карточек) показывается при ширине < 860px; `tools-desktop` (таблица) — при ≥ 860px. Два варианта дополняют, а не дублируют друг друга.
- **D5 — headingMap использует localizedTitle**: Переработан в функцию `buildHeadings(localizedTitle, lang)`. Заголовок "How to use [Calculator Name]" теперь содержит локализованное название для всех 6 языков, а не EN-строку из props.
- **D6 — Ограничение SEO-секций по типу калькулятора**: Создан `src/data/calculator-sections.ts` с маппингом `slug → active sections[]`. Конвертеры показывают 4 секции вместо 10; налоговые — 6; simple tools — 5; DeFi — 8-9. Устраняет near-duplicate content risk.

### Added
- `src/data/calculator-sections.ts` — конфигурация активных SEO-секций для 25+ калькуляторов.

## [2026-03-09] (update 6)

### Added
- **calculator-category-map.ts** — маппинг всех 60+ слагов калькуляторов на категорию хаба + локализованные названия категорий на 6 языках.
- **category-hub-body.ts** — уникальный SEO-текст (~600 слов, 5 параграфов) для каждого из 8 хабов категорий (en). Рендерится в `CategoryHubPage.astro` как prose-секция перед сеткой инструментов.
- **11 новых записей в related-calculators.ts** — кластер risk/performance analytics: sharpe, sortino, calmar, treynor, information-ratio, drawdown, var, risk-of-ruin, kelly, slippage, trade-expectancy.

### Changed
- **3-уровневый breadcrumb (Home → Категория → Калькулятор)**: Обновлён `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` (HTML breadcrumb + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD schema), обновлены 35 custom EN .astro страниц через Python-скрипт. BreadcrumbList schema стала 3-элементной для всех калькуляторных страниц.
- **Обратные ссылки на хаб**: В `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` добавлена ссылка "All [Category] calculators" после Related блока. В 28 custom EN страниц добавлен hub-backlink в Related секцию.
- **Контекстные "See also" ссылки**: В шаблоне добавлен inline callout с первыми 3 related calculators после секции "How to use". В топ-10 custom EN страниц (profit, dca, mining, staking, liquidation, position-size, tax, converter, roi, risk-reward) добавлены inline "See also" блоки.
- **Формат checklist/mistakes**: В `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` секция checklist рендерится как нумерованный `<ol>` с пронумерованными кружками, mistakes — как `<ul>` с предупреждающими иконками.
- **Таблица инструментов в хабах**: В `CategoryHubPage.astro` добавлена таблица всех инструментов категории с прямыми ссылками (дополняет существующую сетку карточек).

## [2026-03-09] (update 5)

### Changed
- **SEO F1 — BreadcrumbList + enriched WebApplication schema на 35 EN страницах**: Добавлен `pageType="calculator"` prop в `Layout.astro` для авто-генерации `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD. Все 35 EN `.astro` калькуляторных страниц обновлены. Кроме того, в каждую inline `WebApplication` схему добавлены `datePublished: "2025-11-01"`, `dateModified: "2026-03-09"`, `author: Person`. Итог: все EN страницы теперь имеют 3 схемы (BreadcrumbList + WebApplication + FAQPage), совпадая с локализованными версиями.

## [2026-03-06]

### Added
- **i18n: localized remaining hardcoded strings in 10 calculators**: Replaced ~80 hardcoded English strings with `getUiString(lang, ...)` calls in Airdrop, FundingRate, Liquidation, Margin, MarketCapComparator, PositionSize, Profit, ReverseRoi, StakingRewards, and TpSl calculators. Added ~230 new translations to `ui-strings.ts` (es, pt, tr, hi, ru) covering labels, placeholders, toggles, hints, and button text.

### Fixed
- **P0 — DCA Calculator broken**: Replaced hardcoded CoinGecko API call with `cryptoPriceService.ts` fallback chain (CoinGecko → CryptoCompare → CoinCap). Fixes 401 errors from expired demo API key.
- **P1 — Right-column truncation on mobile (S1)**: Fixed `.result-value` being clipped on 375px viewports across ~15 calculators. Applied `flex-shrink: 0` to values and `text-overflow: ellipsis` to labels so values are always visible.
- **P2 — Long/Short toggle "Short" text hidden (S3)**: Added `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis` and tighter padding to `.toggle-btn` on mobile.
- **P2 — What-If Calculator button & result truncated (S5)**: Shortened button text from "Calculate What If" to "Calculate"; added `word-break` and responsive `font-size` to `.whatif-hero-value` and `.whatif-stat` for mobile.
- **P2 — Homepage search shows "2 results" for mining (S8)**: Updated search result count to show total calculator count (including tools within categories) instead of card count.
- **P3 — Footer disclaimer not localized (S7)**: Replaced hardcoded English disclaimer in `SiteFooter.astro` with `t.footerDisclaimer`; added translations for all 6 languages.
- **P3 — Hint text truncation (S2)**: Added `-webkit-line-clamp: 2` to `.input-hint` on mobile to gracefully truncate with ellipsis.
- **P3 — Pill mask clipping (S4)**: Adjusted gradient mask from 90% to 92% black to show more of the last pill.

### Changed
- `src/components/DCACalculator.tsx` — imports and uses `getPriceChart()` from `cryptoPriceService.ts`
- `src/styles/global.css` — mobile `.result-row`, `.result-label`, `.result-value`, `.toggle-btn`, `.input-hint`, `.pills-row` overrides
- `src/pages/what-if.astro` — responsive hero value and stat sizing
- `src/components/WhatIfCalculator.tsx` — shorter Calculate button text
- `src/pages/index.astro` — search result counting logic
- `src/components/SiteFooter.astro` — uses `t.footerDisclaimer`
- `src/i18n/translations.ts` — added `footerDisclaimer` key for all 6 languages
- `src/components/{AirdropCalculator,FundingRateCalculator,LiquidationCalculator,MarginCalculator,MarketCapComparator,PositionSizeCalculator,ProfitCalculator,ReverseRoiCalculator,StakingRewardsCalculator,TpSlCalculator}.tsx` — replaced hardcoded English with `getUiString()` calls
- `src/i18n/ui-strings.ts` — added ~230 new string translations for 5 locales

## [2026-03-04]

### Added
- Created `src/utils/cryptoPriceService.ts` — unified crypto price service with automatic fallback chain:
  - **CoinGecko → CryptoCompare → CoinCap** for historical price, current price, and chart data
  - Smart routing: dates older than 365 days skip CoinGecko (free tier limitation) and try CryptoCompare first
  - ID mapping for 30+ popular cryptocurrencies across all three API providers
  - Graceful degradation: chart returns empty array if all providers fail; prices throw with descriptive error

### Changed
- Refactored `src/components/WhatIfCalculator.tsx` to use `cryptoPriceService` instead of direct CoinGecko API calls:
  - Historical and current price now fetched in parallel via `Promise.all` (performance improvement)
  - Quick Scenarios dating back to 2013 (BTC), 2015 (ETH), 2017 (BNB, ADA) now work via CryptoCompare fallback
  - Coin search still uses CoinGecko search endpoint directly (not affected by historical data limits)

### Fixed
- Improved mobile UX and reliability across all calculators:
  - Added `onFocus` auto-selection to all number inputs across all 62 calculator components to prevent input appending errors (e.g. Airdrop, Yield Farming, Mining, Converters, Risk tools, etc.).
  - Added graceful 429 Rate Limit error handling to the DCA Calculator API requests.
  - Added horizontal scroll indicators (padding and gradient mask) to the Quick Scenarios pills row on mobile to improve discoverability.

## [2026-02-26]

### Changed
- Standardized trailing-slash URL behavior for localized routing and canonical generation:
  - `src/i18n/utils.ts`
  - `src/components/SiteFooter.astro`
  - `src/components/LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
- Rebuilt `src/pages/404.astro` into a branded CryptoCalk error experience:
  - removed inline-style placeholder markup;
  - added responsive hero-style card with branded lockup, gradient background, CTA actions, and quick links to core calculators;
  - preserved `noindex` behavior for the error page.
- Installed production Google Analytics tag ID `G-BVPMVV27NH` in the global layout head script:
  - `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- Aligned internal page links to trailing-slash format across core EN calculator pages and homepage/navigation templates to reduce avoidable `301` hops.
- Updated redirect targets to trailing-slash canonical destinations:
  - `public/_redirects`
- Updated robots sitemap declaration to `/sitemap.xml`:
  - `public/robots.txt`
- Added immutable/static cache policies for built assets and hourly freshness for crawl files:
  - `public/_headers`

### Added
- Added sitemap compatibility output so `dist/sitemap.xml` is generated from `dist/sitemap-index.xml` during build:
  - `scripts/postbuild-platform-files.mjs`
- Added `WebPage` JSON-LD on trust pages (EN + localized):
  - `src/pages/about.astro`
  - `src/pages/contact.astro`
  - `src/pages/terms.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/about.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/contact.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/terms.astro`

### Fixed
- Marked custom 404 page as non-indexable via layout prop:
  - `src/pages/404.astro`
- Localized cookie-policy link generation now follows language path + trailing slash:
  - `src/components/CookieBanner.astro`
  - `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- Fixed localized style verification scope to skip non-calculator localized static pages (`about`, `contact`, `terms`) to keep CI checks aligned with their intended target set:
  - `scripts/verify-localized-styles.mjs`

## [2026-02-25]

### Changed
- Removed the global `ChangeNowWidget.astro` ("Exchange Crypto Instantly") from the calculator shell to simplify the UI and remove third-party iframes per owner request.
- Globally applied CoinGecko Demo API key (`CG-Zeo2WrX3r7J1oUoX1kSnutmz`) as a query parameter (`x_cg_demo_api_key`) to all 22 calculator components to securely fetch market data and bypass 401 Unauthorized limits.

## [2026-02-24]

### Added
- Created `src/i18n/calculator-meta.ts` dictionary containing 255 native-language titles and localized descriptions for all 51 calculators across 5 locales (`es`, `pt`, `tr`, `hi`, `ru`).
- Created `src/i18n/faq-dictionary.ts` capturing 30 localized FAQ items for 5 non-English languages to support global trust and credibility.

### Changed
- `getLocalizedCalculatorMeta()` in `src/i18n/utils.ts` now uses O(1) property lookup from `CALCULATOR_META` instead of procedurally title-casing URL slugs. This fixes the SEO title grammar (L2 localization fix).
- Replaced hardcoded English `defaultFaq` array in `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` with dynamic dictionary queries matching the request locale, completing the L3 default FAQ translation task.
- Replaced the large block of English SEO body text in `LocalizedCalculatorPage.astro` with a dynamic 6-language dictionary mapping from `src/i18n/seo-body-text.ts`, completing the L4 localization task.
- Implemented a hybrid React component UI localization model across all calculators, mapping the top 100 output strings and empty states into 5 languages via a new `ui-strings.ts` dictionary and passing the `lang` prop through Astro templates (L5 localization task).

## [2026-02-21]

### Added
- Added localized slug alias generation for all spec calculators in:
  - `src/pages/[lang]/[...slug].astro`
  - Generates localized route slugs for `es`, `pt`, `tr`, `hi`, and `ru` from the canonical calculator slug set.
- Added dedicated category hub data model and shared category-page template:
  - `src/data/category-hubs.ts`
  - `src/components/CategoryHubPage.astro`
  - Centralized category slugs, calculator mappings, localized UI copy, and reusable hub layout blocks.
- Added SEO indexable category routes (EN + localized):
  - `src/pages/calculators/[category].astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/calculators/[category].astro`
  - Published category landing pages with `CollectionPage`, `ItemList`, `FAQPage`, and `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD.

### Changed
- Replaced dynamic calculator module loading in:
  - `src/pages/[lang]/[...slug].astro`
  - Switched to static component imports + explicit per-slug rendering branches so Astro can resolve hydration imports for islands.
- Preserved localized SEO path wiring for alias routes:
  - `src/pages/[lang]/[...slug].astro`
  - Alias pages continue to pass `pathOverride` and canonical slug into `LocalizedCalculatorPage` for localized metadata/canonical URL output.
- Synced release documentation with current build/deploy reality:
  - `DEPLOY.md`
  - `PREPUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md`
  - Updated build output reference to `688 pages` and moved checklist verification date to `2026-02-21`, including redirect-file validation in SEO baseline.
- Redesigned homepage discovery flow for both EN and localized roots:
  - `src/pages/index.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
  - Restored mobile search visibility in sticky header, added inline clear action, added search result feedback + explicit empty state, reduced “Popular Calculators” to curated high-intent set, and simplified footer information architecture into compact link groups.
- Improved keyboard and touch UX for global header controls:
  - `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`
  - `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
  - `src/styles/global.css`
  - Added keyboard navigation for language dropdown (Arrow keys/Home/End/Escape), larger 44px+ touch targets, and replaced inline toggle styles with reusable global class.
- Increased baseline readability/contrast and focus visibility:
  - `src/styles/global.css`
  - Tuned light/dark text tokens, added global `:focus-visible` ring styles, and added `sr-only` utility class for accessible labels.
- Extended i18n dictionary for new homepage UX copy:
  - `src/i18n/translations.ts`
  - Added localized strings for search labels, clear action, result/empty-state messaging, stat labels, and localized “Popular/Trending” badges.
- Refactored homepage category cards to point to category hubs instead of single calculators:
  - `src/pages/index.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
  - Converted cards to semantic `article` blocks with direct links to both category hubs and top calculators inside each category.

### Deviated
- Expanded homepage URL architecture beyond the original calculator-only route plan by adding `/calculators/[category]` hubs.
  - Reason: user-approved UX/SEO decision to improve category discoverability, crawlability, and navigation clarity.

### Fixed
- Fixed Astro build error on localized alias pages:
  - `[NoMatchingImport] Could not render CalculatorComponent`
  - Example affected route: `/es/conversor-cripto/`.
- Fixed localized style verification false positive for dynamic alias route:
  - `scripts/verify-localized-styles.mjs`
  - Dynamic localized route files (for example `[...slug].astro`) are now excluded from EN source-style checks.
- Prevented duplicate-index risk for old localized calculator paths after slug localisation:
  - `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
  - Pages whose runtime path is not canonical now emit `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` automatically while preserving canonical URL tags.
- Prevented legacy localized calculator URLs from being published in sitemap:
  - `astro.config.mjs`
  - Added sitemap `filter` that excludes non-canonical locale paths like `/es/profit-calculator`, keeping only localized slug variants for spec calculators.
- Added explicit 301 redirects from legacy localized calculator URLs to localized slug URLs:
  - `public/_redirects`
  - Auto-generated 510 redirect rules (`255` source→target mappings with and without trailing slash) for `es`, `pt`, `tr`, `hi`, `ru`.
- Ensured platform routing files are present in production build output:
  - `scripts/postbuild-platform-files.mjs`
  - `package.json`
  - `npm run build` now copies `public/_redirects` (and `public/_headers` if present) into `dist/` after `astro build`.
- Added slug-migration regression guard for CI:
  - `scripts/verify-slug-migration.mjs`
  - `package.json`
  - Validates 3 conditions for localized calculator slug migration: canonical localized URLs are present in sitemap, legacy localized URLs are absent from sitemap, and both legacy path variants map to `301` redirects in `dist/_redirects`.
- Added prepublish check entry for slug migration validation:
  - `PREPUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md`
  - Requires `npm run verify:slug-migration` as part of SEO baseline release checks.
- Fixed mobile UX regression where homepage search/navigation controls were hidden below `768px`:
  - `src/pages/index.astro`
  - `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
  - Mobile users now keep immediate access to tool discovery without scrolling through full page content.
- Fixed incomplete localization on homepage stats and tag labels:
  - `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro`
  - `src/i18n/translations.ts`
  - Replaced hardcoded EN labels (`Languages`, `Ads`, `Load`) and badge terms with locale-aware strings.
